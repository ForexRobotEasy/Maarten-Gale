## Code Explanation

### Input Parameters

1. `IncreaseFactor`: Trade size increase factor.
2. `MaxConsecutiveLosses`: Maximum number of consecutive losing trades for size increase.
3. `MaxConsecutiveWins`: Maximum number of consecutive winning trades for size increase.
4. `RiskTolerancePercentage`: Risk tolerance percentage.
5. `TakeProfitPercentage`: Take-profit rate percentage.

### Global Variables

1. `initialLotSize`: Initial trade size.
2. `currentLotSize`: Current trade size.
3. `consecutiveLosses`: Counter for consecutive losses.
4. `consecutiveWins`: Counter for consecutive wins.

### Expert Initialization Function (`OnInit`)

This function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It calculates the initial lot size based on the account balance and risk tolerance. It sets the current lot size to the initial lot size and resets the consecutive losses and consecutive wins counters.

### Expert Tick Function (`OnTick`)

This function is called on every tick. It checks if there are consecutive losses or wins. If there are consecutive losses, it calculates the new trade size based on the previous trade size and the increase factor. If the maximum number of consecutive losses is reached, the consecutive losses counter is reset. Similarly, if there are consecutive wins, it calculates the new trade size and resets the consecutive wins counter. Finally, it places a trade with the current lot size using the `PlaceTrade` function.

### Calculate Take-Profit Rate Function (`CalculateTakeProfitRate`)

This function calculates the take-profit rate based on the ask price and the specified take-profit rate percentage.

### Place Trade Function (`PlaceTrade`)

This function is responsible for placing a trade with the specified lot size. The implementation code for placing the trade is not provided in this sample code.

### Adjust Trade Size Function (`AdjustTradeSize`)

This function is called to adjust the trade size dynamically based on the updated account balance and risk tolerance. It recalculates the current lot size.

### Expert Deinitialization Function (`OnDeinit`)

This function is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It can be used to perform any necessary clean-up tasks, although no specific implementation is provided in this sample code.
